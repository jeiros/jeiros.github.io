I'm a PhD student at the [Institute of Chemical Biology](http://www.icb-cdt.co.uk/) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/).

I apply Molecular Dynamics simulations to understand the behaviour of cardiac Troponin, an important regulatory protein that is involved the 
muscle contraction process.

Because for my PhD I spend all my time in front of a computer, I've developed an interest for computer science, although my formal background
is in Chemistry.
