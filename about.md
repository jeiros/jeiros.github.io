- I'm originally from Barcelona, Spain. I studied Chemistry there at the [Institut Químic de Sarrià](https://www.iqs.edu/en) from 2010 to 2014

- I moved to London in 2014 to study an MRes in Chemical Biology at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) thanks to a scholarship from [La Caixa](https://obrasociallacaixa.org/en/educacion-becas)

- Now I'm a PhD student at the [Institute of Chemical Biology](http://www.icb-cdt.co.uk/) at the same institution

- My research interests lie at the interface of Biochemistry and Computer Simulations. In particular, I use MD simulations to study the structure and dynamics
of cardiac Troponin, an important regulatory protein that is involved the muscle contraction process.

- I enjoy coding in Python due to its expressivity and ease of development for data analysis and scientific visualization.

- I have a passion for teaching, so you might expect some blog posts from me explaing some topic or software trick that I have found useful. I have also been a Graduate Teaching Assistant for a handful of
courses at Imperial and also am a certified [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) Instructor.
